# Learn AWS / S3

[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) provides cloud storage,
which is useful because it provides an off-site redundant copy of files
that can be accessed by other entities via Amazon's industry-strength web infrastructure.

S3 is useful for publishing static websites and other content delivery network resources.
