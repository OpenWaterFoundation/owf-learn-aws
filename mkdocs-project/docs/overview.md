# Learn AWS / Overview

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
provides cloud-based services such as file storage, websites, virtual machines, and other technology services.
Such services are increasingly an option that allow organizations to implement information technology
solutions for internal operations and to provide products and services.
This documentation will be expanded over time with working examples.

The Open Water Foundation recommends using AWS for the following purposes:

* Cloud storage - the S3 service provides cost-effective cloud storage for static websites, archives, and systems.

## Alternatives to AWS

Alternatives to AWS should be considered where AWS does not satisfy requirements or another solution is preferred by an organization.
It is also possible to mix and match cloud services, although a price is incurred.
Many services have cost based on the level of service used and therefore can scale as needed.
Alternatives to AWS include:

* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
