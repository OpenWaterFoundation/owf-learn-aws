## Introduction ##

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
provides cloud-based services such as file storage, content delivery networks, virtual machines, databases, and other services.
Such services are increasingly an option that allow organizations to implement information technology
solutions for internal operations and to provide products and services.

The Open Water Foundation uses AWS internally and for our clients.
This documentation will be expanded over time as services continue to be implemented.

## Alternatives to AWS

Alternatives to AWS should be considered where AWS does not satisfy requirements or another solution is preferred by an organization.
It is also possible to mix and match cloud services, although a price is incurred.
Many services have cost based on the level of service used and therefore can scale as needed.
Primary alternatives to AWS include:

*   [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
*   [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
