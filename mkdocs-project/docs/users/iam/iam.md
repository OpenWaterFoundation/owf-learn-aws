# AWS / Users and Roles / IAM

AWS access and permissions is controlled by [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).
Users are given access to AWS by a login and are given roles with permissions to use web services.

* See: [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)

This documentation needs to be expanded.
