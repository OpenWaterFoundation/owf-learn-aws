## Introduction ##

Cloud storage is infrastructure to store electronic content (files) in the cloud.

Cloud storage can take different forms.
For example, [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?_hp=c),
[Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), and
[Microsoft OneDrive](https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) provide services that are
easy to use because they integrate with desktop computers and allow using files for personal use and sharing files within an organization.
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and similar provide cloud storage for software files while focusing on features to manage file changes.
Other solutions provide specific functionality.

AWS provides various cloud storage services:
