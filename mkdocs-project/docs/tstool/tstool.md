# AWS / TSTool Integration #

Automated AWS workflows can be implemented using various tools.
For example, Linux Bash scripts can be written that use the
[AWS command line interface](../cli/cli.md).
However, this can be cumbersome and require programming skills.

Another option is to use the Open Water Foundation TSTool AWS Plugin,
which provides commands for TSTool software.
